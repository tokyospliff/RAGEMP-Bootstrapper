## ℹ️ About

This bootstrapper was originally built for **my own RAGE:MP server** to fix  
crashes caused by **colshape events** and `NullReferenceException`.

Later on I moved to a **completely different to an advanced system**,  
so I decided to release this **for free**, in case it helps others facing the same issues.

If you find bugs, problems, or have improvements,  
feel free to **open an issue, report it, or fork the project**.

## 🛡️ What it does

- Prevents colshape-related crashes  
- Blocks `NullReferenceException`  
- Makes server startup more stable
- Reduces massive lag on high demand players 
- Logs errors instead of crashing the server
